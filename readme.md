This repo contains the source code of the webapp created as a part of Capital One webapp challenge. The topic of the challenge was to create a webpage that would provide insightful analysis of the San Francisco emergency services data.

The webpage that I created is divided into six distinct sections (excluding the intro section) with each section answering the required prompts of the challenge. 

Technology used:

For this challenge, I decided to use React JS with Express backend and PostgreSQL database service.

Libraries used:

react-chartsjs-2
google-map-react
react-fullpagejs
react-bootstrap

Boilerplate code : https://github.com/aautio/react-express-postgres-heroku

Improvements that could be made: The website could be made more complex with multiple pages and more data analysis by attempting to factor in various parameters and using more robust techniques.

The website could be made responsive to support multiple screen resolution. Currently, the website uses bootstrap grid layout, but as per testing, it still fails to support specific screen resolutions.

The website could be made more user interactive and appealing.
